# The Project

It's a simple project, focused on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It was interesting to search for the right commands and to challenge myself 
to create the "random" funcionalities. This project is a test from "The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu, which 
I've been taking for some months. But still, I wanted to make my customizations and to enjoy myself with the challenge doing by myself.
